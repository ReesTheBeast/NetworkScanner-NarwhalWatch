# Narwhal Watch - Vulnerability Scanner

**Narwhal Watch** is a Python-based network and web application vulnerability scanner designed to assess security weaknesses in networks and web applications. This tool is suitable for both educational purposes and authorized security testing.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Scans a specified target IP for open ports commonly used by network services.
- **Operating System Detection**: Attempts to identify the OS type based on response signatures.
- **Web Application Vulnerability Checks**:
  - Detects missing security headers.
  - Scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
  - Checks for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risks.
  - Tests for directory traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Brute-force Login Test**: Attempts common username and password combinations.
- **Data Leak Checks**:
  - Uses the [Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) to check if a domain has been part of any data breaches.
  - Searches GitHub for files containing the specified domain for potential data exposure.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `colorama`
  - `socket`
- **Optional API Access**:
  - HIBP API Key
  - GitHub API Token (recommended for GitHub domain leak checks)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ReesTheBeast/narwhal-watch.git
   cd narwhal-watch
Install the necessary libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API keys if you want to access all features.

Usage
To run the vulnerability scanner, use:


python main.py
Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a target IP address for network scanning.
Then, enter a target URL for web application vulnerability scanning.
If you have API keys, enter them to enable the domain leak checks on HIBP and GitHub.
Output and Reporting
The scanner outputs a detailed report to the terminal, including:

Network Scan Results: Displays open ports detected on the target IP.
Operating System Information: Attempts to identify the detected OS.
Web Application Scan Results: Lists potential vulnerabilities, including:
Missing security headers.
SQL Injection.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Directory traversal vulnerabilities.
Brute-force login test results.
Domain Leak and GitHub Leak Check: Shows any data leaks associated with the domain.
